# 👋 Hi there, I'm Nwankwo Charles Nnabuike (Charlie Soft)

I'm a Certified Full Stack Web Developer (NIIT) and Cybersecurity Specialist (Cisco).  
Passionate about building robust web applications and securing digital systems.

💻 I work with modern technologies like:
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL
- Tools: Git, GitHub, REST APIs, Docker

🔐 I also have a strong foundation in network security, ethical hacking, and secure coding practices.

I love solving real-world problems through clean, efficient code — and I enjoy working on projects that challenge my creativity and logic.

🌍 I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities in Canada or remote/fulltime job roles with relocation support.
